# Translation HOWTO for note-taking and personal reference

# Add a new language

Creates a new empty .po file for a specific translation

        msginit --locale=LL  #  LL is the language code used


Updates the .po file from the template, while merging existing template strings. Should be called when 
the translatable strings have changed?

        intltool-update LL   # LL is the language code used


# File types

./po directory contains all files needed for translation

./po/telegram-purple.pot is a translation template for creating other .po for specific translations. The file is
                         created by letting intltool-update --pot search through all source files (defined in
                         potfiles.in) that contain translatable strings.

./po/de.po            German locale, created by calling msginit --locale=de from telegram-purple.pot
