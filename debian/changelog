telegram-purple (1.3.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Hugues Morisset ]
  * Initial Release (Closes: #833793)

  [ Ben Wiederhake ]
  * Please note that due to the format-switch in 1.2.6, the file
    /etc/telegram-purple/server.pub is obsolete for all version after it.
    It is ignored to allow for smooth transition from old, manual
    installations, and may be removed in future versions.
  * New upstream release
    - Add translations and plural support
    - Fix lots of bugs around secret chats (still not perfect, though)
    - Fix behavior around hibernation
    - Fix display errors and false warnings
    - Fix crash on 'unsupported' media
    - Support supergroups and channels
